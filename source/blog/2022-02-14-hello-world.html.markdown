Some time after starting coding I learned, and if you code probably you learned it too, that if my first code in a new lang wasn't some kind of printing "Hello world" I'd be **doomed to never learn** that specific lang.

At first, it seems like a funny little joke that I could tell my friends, but then people around me started taking it too serious and it became kinda silly.
After some time I came to notice something nice about it, hear me out on this:

>The "Hello world" joke is more than that, it is kind of a whole philosophy in disguise. To tell the truth, I even think it should be something that is taught in colleges with more emphasis.

*"The coffee is frying your brain, Raul"* you may think. And though you're correct, let me explain why this isn't because of that:

Coding is like talking in a foreign language, you have to understand how the syntax work, how to order nouns, verbs, articles and everything correctly to form a sentence that **makes sense**. If you don't know how to do it to *perfection*, that is no problem, everyone will understand you even if not making the most of what you <strike>tried</strike> to say. *However*, if you try to make your first phrase in a new language be in the more-than-perfect-past-hiper-mega-blaster tense, you'll probably have some trouble doing it, and probably people won't understand what you are trying to say. Even if you study that specific tense, you will lack the basics to make it work.

*"That's freaking obvious"* you may yell at me. And again you're correct! But this **doesn't** seem to be the case for many new developers (and experienced) for some reason.

**Bear** with me, if you studied a language other than your native one, you *probably* learned how to introduce yourself at the first class, something like "Hello, my name is Raul" (If your name is Raul as well xD).
*And that makes sense* since it is your first contact with a whole new language, it's nice to be something relatable. Remember that a language isn't just new words, it's a whole new world: a new form of thinking, new forms of counting and measuring, new culture with different costumes and everything. **So it is with a new programming language**. For example, if you speak French, learning other Latin originated languages is easier, the forms are the same and many words correlate. That would be like someone that knows Python learning Ruby, both are Object oriented, both are dynamically typed, heck both even have some similar syntaxes. However, there are differences that if you don't understand the basics and concepts behind the lang it will bite you in the arse sometime or another.

At college, I learned C, C++ and Java and I hated it (Just like I hated learning french), then I started working with PHP and *oh boy* it was so much easier. With PHP I worked with Laravel for some time, learned pretty much all the basics of MVC with it! And soon I moved on to work with Ruby on Rails, it was love at first sight. I was already used to the concept of Rails thanks to Laravel, many of the things that PHP does Ruby also does (and much easier in many cases).

However, in the beginning I did lose a lot of time trying to do something and not understanding why it wouldn't work until someone explains that *"Rails does not work that way"*. I felt really *dumb* all the times that happened and decided that I needed to really learn **how** ruby and rails worked **and why** it worked that way. After that, *every single time* I needed to do something I'd open the *Rails guides* and *Ruby docs* and searched the canonical way todo something I was trying to do, read the doc explanation and if that wasn't clear enough, search some article about it. That helped me not only learn how to use better the language but also identify when it could have problems and diagnose the reason behind bugs or *unexpected magic behaviors*.

At the beginning of this year (2022) I accepted an offer to work with a different lang, a different paradigm. From Ruby on Rails to Clojure (F*ck me right? lol). At first I was really scared when opening the github repositories and trying to understand what was happening, it was actually the same feel from when I opened the first page of my Japanese class book. Seeing all sorts of ideograms that I needed to understand but seemed so overwhelmingly complex that I'd never be capable of.

**So what I did was** figuring out how to print "Hello, world!" on the console. It was very simple, then I proceeded to learning about logic operators, conditionals, loops, how functional programming was supposed to work, the difference between classes with methods and namespaces with functions and so on. After some months I still feel insecure about the code I'm writing, but I'm capable of making things work thanks to reading about the basics first, trying and experiencing.

**Making basic code and failing**, to me, is the very best thing to learn a new language. You read the docs, understand why it failed, the expected input, behavior and output. Then, when I started creating more complex things I already know what each individual part work, communicate and can be put together.

Coding, at the end, is taking all the atomic things the lang provides and putting it together to make some bigger piece work, and then making even bigger pieces with those and so on.
The anxiety of getting your hands dirty with the big ideas upfront and trying to figure out why that gigantic function you created isn't working without really knowing what each part does is a great part of the feeling of impotency, which may lead you to think you're not enough for the job.

It turned out that I do can speak Japanese after learning what each basic ideogram means, and then putting them together to create words and then using those to make complex *Kanji*'s. I also can make entire services in Clojure, and so can you do it in a new language if you take the time to learn the basics and do it deeply.
