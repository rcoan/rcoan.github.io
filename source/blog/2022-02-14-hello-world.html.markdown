I learned some time after starting coding, and probably you heard this too, that if my first code in a new lang wasn't some kind of printing "Hello world" I'd be **doomed to never learn** that specific lang.

At first it seems like a funny little joke that I could make with friends, but then people started taking it too serious and it became silly to me.
But I came to notice something nice about it, hear me out on this:

>The "Hello world" joke is more than that, it is kind of a whole philosophy in disguise. To tell the truth, I even think it should be something that is teached in colleges with more emphasis.

*"The coffe is frying your brain, Raul"* you may think. And though you're correct, let me explain why this isn't because of that:

Coding is like talking in a foreign language, you have to understand how the syntax work, how to order nouns, verbs, articles and averything correctly to form a sentence that makes sense. If you don't know how to do it to *perfection*, that is no problem, everyone will understand you even if not making the most of what you <strike>tried</strike> to say. **But**, if you try to go directly to saying a sentence in the more-than-perfect-past-hiper-mega-blaster tense, you'll probably have some trouble to do it, and probably people wont understand what you've tried to say.

*"That's freaking obvious"* you may yell at me. And again you're correct! But this **doesn't** seem to be the case for many developers for some reason.

**bear** with me, if you studied another language then your native one you *probably* learned how to introduce yourself at the first class, something like "Hello, my name is Raul" (If your name is Raul as well xD).
*And that makes sense* since it is your first contact with a whole new language. Remember that a language isn't just new words, it's kinda a whole world, a new form of thinking, new forms of counting and measuring, new culture with differents costumes and everything. **So it is with a new programming language**.
